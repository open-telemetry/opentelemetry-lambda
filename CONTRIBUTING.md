## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Sign the CLA

Before you can contribute, you will need to sign the [Contributor License
Agreement](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors).

### Code attribution

[License information](README.md#License) should be included in all source files where applicable.
Either full or short version of the header should be used as described at [apache.org](http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#Apply-My-Software).
It is OK to exclude the year from the copyright notice. For the details on how to apply the copyright,
see the next section.

### Copyright Notices

OpenTelemetry follows [CNCF recommendations](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/copyright-notices.md)
for copyright notices. We use "Copyright The OpenTelemetry Authors" notice form.

According to CNCF recommendations if you are contributing third-party code
you will need to [retain the original copyright notice](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/copyright-notices.md#dont-change-someone-elses-notice-without-their-permission).

Any contributed third-party code must originally be Apache 2.0-Licensed or must
carry a permisive software license that is compatible when combining with
Apache 2.0 License. At this moment, BSD and MIT are the only
[OSI-approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) known to be compatible.

If you make substantial changes to the third-party code, _prepend_ the contributed
third party file with OpenTelemetry's copyright notice.

If the contributed code is not third-party code and you are the author we
strongly encourage to avoid including your name in the notice and use the
generic "Copyright The OpenTelemetry Authors" notice. See rationale for this
recommendation [here](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/copyright-notices.md#why-not-list-every-copyright-holder).

## Community Expectations and Roles

OpenTelemetry is a community project. Consequently, it is wholly dependent on
its community to provide a productive, friendly, and collaborative environment.
