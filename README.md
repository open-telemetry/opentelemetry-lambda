## OpenTelemetry Lambda Layers

The OpenTelemetry Lambda Layers provide the OpenTelemetry (OTel) code to export telemetry asynchronously from AWS Lambdas. It does this by embedding a stripped-down version of [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) inside an [AWS Lambda Extension Layer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-extensions-in-preview/).

Some layers include the corresponding OTel language SDK for the Lambda. This allows Lambdas to use OpenTelemetry to send traces and metrics to any configured backend.

## Extension Layer Language Support

* ### [Java + Collector Lambda Layer](java/README.md)

## FAQ

* **What exporters/receivers/processors are included from the OpenTelemetry Collector?**
    > You can check out [the stripped-down collector's imports](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-lambda/blob/main/collector/lambdacomponents/default.go#L18) in this repository for a full list of currently included components.
* **Is the Lambda layer provided or do I need to build it and distribute it myself?**
    > This repository does not provide pre-build Lambda layers. They must be built manually and saved in your AWS account. This repo has files to facilitate doing that. More information is provided in [the Collector folder's README](collector/README.md).

## Design Proposal

To get a better understanding of the proposed design for the OpenTelemetry Lambda extension, you can see the [Design Proposal here.](docs/design_proposal.md)

## Features

The following is a list of features provided by the OpenTelemetry layers.

### OpenTelemetry collector

The layer includes the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Lambda extension.

### Custom context propagation carrier extraction

Context can be propagated through various mechanisms (e.g. http headers (APIGW), message attributes (SQS), ...). In some cases, it may be required to pass a custom context propagation extractor in lambda through configuration, this feature allows this through Lambda instrumentation configuration.

### X-Ray Env Var Span Link

This links a context extracted from the Lambda runtime environment to the instrumentation-generated span rather than disabling that context extraction entirely.

### Semantic conventions

The Lambda language implementation follows the semantic conventions specified in the OpenTelemetry Specification.

### Auto instrumentation

The Lambda layer includes support for automatically instrumentation code via the use of instrumentation libraries.

### Flush TracerProvider

The Lambda instrumentation will flush the `TracerProvider` at the end of an invocation.

### Flush MeterProvider

The Lambda instrumentation will flush the `MeterProvider` at the end of an invocation.

The table below captures the state of various features and their levels of support different runtimes.
