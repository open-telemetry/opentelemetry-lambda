`otel-handler`

This script is a wrapper around the existing `otel-instrument` script to maintain
backward compatibility while providing a more descriptive name.

It simply forwards all arguments to the `otel-instrument` script.

Usage
-----
Use this script exactly as you would use `otel-instrument`:

.. code::

    AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER = /opt/otel-handler

END_DOCUMENTATION

# Get the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Call the original otel-instrument script with all passed arguments
exec "${SCRIPT_DIR}/otel-instrument" "$@"
