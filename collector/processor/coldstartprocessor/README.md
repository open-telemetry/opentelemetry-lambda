This processor associates cold start information generated by the [telemetryapireceiver](../../receiver/telemetryapireceiver) with incoming span data processed by
the Collector extension. It reads the following of incoming Lambda execution spans identified by the `faas.execution` attribute:

- trace ID
- parent span ID
- span scope
- resource attributes

This information is stored until the first coldstart span identified by the `faas.coldstart` attribute
is received. That span's trace ID, parent span ID are updated to match the execution span. This
allows the coldstart span to be part of the same trace as the operation that triggered the cold start. Additionally,
the span scope and resource attributes of the span scope containing the coldstart span
are replaced with the span scope and resource attributes of the execution span as
they contain more details.

There are currently no configuration parameters available for this processor. It can be enabled via the following configuration:

```yaml
processors:
    coldstart:
```
