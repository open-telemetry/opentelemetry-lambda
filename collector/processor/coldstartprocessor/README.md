This processor associates cold start information generated by the [telemetryapireceiver](../../receiver/telemetryapireceiver) with the first span processed by the Collector extension containing a `faas.execution` attribute.

There are currently no configuration parameters available for this processor. It can be enabled via the following configuration:

```yaml
processors:
    coldstart:
```
