This receiver generates telemetry in response to events from the [Telemetry API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api.html). It does this by setting up an endpoint and registering itself with the Telemetry API on startup.

Supported events:

* `platform.initStart` - The receiver uses this event to record the start time of the function initialization period. Once both start and end times are recorded, the receiver generates a span named `platform.initRuntimeDone` to record the event.
* `platform.initRuntimeDone` - The receiver uses this event to record the end time of the function initialization period. Once both start and end times are recorded, the receiver generates a span named `platform.initRuntimeDone` to record the event.
