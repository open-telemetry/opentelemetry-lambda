# Building the Node.js Public Layer from Source

This sample application is the same as the [public layer sample app](../../sample-apps/aws-sdk) except it builds the Node.js SDK and Collector layers from source. To deploy this sample app, simply run:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Then visit the API GateWay endpoint that's generated.
