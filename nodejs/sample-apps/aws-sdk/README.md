# AWS SDK Sample Application

**This Sample App is a work-in-progress because it depends on the OpenTelemetry public layer. The public layer will not be published

This sample application demonstrates usage of the AWS SDK. To try it out, make sure the collector and nodejs Lambda
layers are built.

In [collector](../../../collector), run `make package`.
In [nodejs](../../), run `npm install`.

Then, run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`. The lambda function will be initialized and the URL for an API Gateway invoking the Lambda
will be displayed at the end. Send a request to the URL in a browser or using curl to execute the function. Then,
navigate to the function's logs [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logStream:group=%252Faws%252Flambda%252Fhello-nodejs).
You will see a log stream with an event time corresponding to when you issued the request - open it and you can find
information about the exported spans in the log stream.
